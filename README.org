#+TITLE: Lemonade

Experiment in higher order visual programming.

Check out [[https://github.com/tgetgood/expanse][Expanse]] to see it in use.

* Overview
	This is both a library for doing vector graphics in a data driven idiomatic
	clojure fashion

	The name is a reference to a name I thought up for a presentation once. It's
	not a great name, but it could be worse.
* Breakdown
	=lemonade.core=: The core graphics primitives.

	=lemonade.math=: Mathematical and interop helpers.

	=lemonade.geometry=: Geometric model of the rendered world to map back and
	forth from screen coordinates to fibres of the render tree.

	Renderers are in =lemonade.renderers.*=. There are currently only 2, an HTML
	Canvas 2d rendering context renderer for the browser and a quil renderer for
	JVM Clojure. Both renderers are working and should produce identical
	results. I'd be much obliged to anyone who can point out where they don't.

	The definition of shapes is probably going to change from one based on curves
	and winding numbers as most graphics libraries do to a constructive
	topology. That is glue together locally convex simply connected shapes to
	produce non simple shapes, and subtract one shape from another. I'm still
	thinking out the details.
* Getting Started
	[[https://github.com/tgetgood/expanse][Expanse]] is the place to go if you want to see Lemonade in action or play with
	running code.
* Testing
	Having a fully declarative model of the UI allows headless testing of most UI
	components. You can determine the exact pixel coordinates of any shape or the
	colour of any pixel without rendering anything. At least in principle. Lemonade
	itself needs some heavy testing to make sure this is true.
